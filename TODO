TODO:

Last thing that was done: got the game to start in client/server setting. We now want to accept input packets so that the game can do stuff! This'll take:
- Support on the server end/protocol for receiving input messages
-- Server can just start by forwarding inputs along

NEXT (I think):
- Rest of the game loop (reset, goodbye, etc)

NEXT NEXT, robust transport and time sync
