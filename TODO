Next high-level goal: Start prototyping gameplay
* Cleaner ECS setup - use Object class + subsystem provider
-- Getting there. Need cleaner asset story.
-- AssetStorageProvider class, provides access to specific storage objects and 
   general asset storage. Plumb that through and we'll be in good shape, I hope.
* Characters - procedural cubes
* "Ball" - procedural cube
* Swipe FX
* Collision
