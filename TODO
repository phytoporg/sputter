TODO:

Last thing implemented:
- Support on the server end/protocol for receiving input messages
-- Server starting by forwarding inputs along
- Starting on more compact protocol w/chunks. Starting on a Channel abstraction.
-- Send buffer implemented, needs recv buffer. Nothing tested yet.
-- Need to create "Message" chunk to wrap existing protocol messages, remove redundant chunks

NEXT:
- Time sync
-- What goes into computing a target frame? May need:
-- More compact protocol: chunks rather than individual messages for ping/RTT, status
-- Introduce a "Channel" to abstract chunking within the protocol

NEXT NEXT,
Rest of the game loop (reset, goodbye, etc)
Robust transport and time sync
