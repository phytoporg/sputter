TODO:

Last thing implemented:
- Support on the server end/protocol for receiving input messages
-- Server starting by forwarding inputs along

NEXT:
- Time sync
-- What goes into computing a target frame? May need:
-- More compact protocol: chunks rather than individual messages for ping/RTT, status

NEXT NEXT,
Rest of the game loop (reset, goodbye, etc)
Robust transport and time sync
