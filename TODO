Sprite animation!
- SpriteAnimationAtlas class
-- Stores atlas texture reference
-- Stores one or more named AnimationSequence classes

- SpriteAnimationSequence class
-- Array of SpriteAnimationFrame objects
-- AnimationFrame = 4 UV coords, maybe don't need a whole other class/struct

- ISpriteAnimationTimer (or maybe an abstract class?
-- Ifc for mapping of timeline-to-sequence frame #
-- We can start with LinearSpriteAnimationTimer
-- Ifc:
--- SetPlayration(float to playrate) <-- optional, default is 1.0f
--- Tick(dt) <-- ITickable?
--- GetCurrentFrameNumber()
-- ^In the future, may also contain metadata for events

- Integration with SpriteBatch?
-- Sprite exposes UVs, defaults to assuming entire texture
-- Can optionally attach sequence & timer to sprite, informs UV fetches
