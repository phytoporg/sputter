Currently working on: asset loader!
- Loads resources from a directory root
-- Uses relative path to identify those resources hierarchically
-- Resources may be: png images, wav files... probably other things too

- Surfaces resources into *easily usable* data formats
-- Images to uint8*, etc.

- RENDERING library converts to textures

Sprites can create from uint8*s (wrap these in some ImageData struct or something)
- SpriteRegistry tracks all created sprites, can report batches for rendering
