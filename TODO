Currently working on sprite batches!
- SpriteBatch can have sprites added to it
- VBO and index buffers get populated
- Currently unsure if things are initializing properly, and no draw call is ever made.
-- Is Flush() the right place for that? Or do we want some kind of batch renderer?
-- Draw() instead of Flush()

Gonna have to include shaders in the asset pipeline as well, most likely.
-- Need generic sprite shader, should be pretty straightforward
-- Process transforms on the CPU for now

^Once this is all working, CPU-side may need some adjustments for fixed-point math.
- Sprite positions and such should be fixed point, rendering logic converts to floating point.
